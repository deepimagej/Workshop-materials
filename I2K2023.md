# I2K 2023: Leveraging Cloud-Based Virtual Desktops for Bioimage Analysis with BAND and DeepImageJ
This file is a guide for a hands-on session for the I2K 2023 conference. The session will be divided into two main parts: one will explore the [BAND]() platform and the other will explore the DeepImageJ plugin for Fiji as well as the BioImage Model Zoo.

In this hands-on session, you will explore the capabilities of [DeepImageJ]() and the [BioImage Model Zoo](). These tools are essential for bioimage analysis and deep learning in the field of microscopy. The session is divided into four parts, with a total of three exercises that will help you get acquainted with these powerful tools.


## Exercise 1: Exploring the BioImage Model Zoo
Time: 5 minutes

**Objective**: Familiarize yourself with the BioImage Model Zoo and understand how to access documentation and resources.

1. Go to the BioImage Model Zoo. Here, you will find a vast collection of pre-trained deep learning models for various bioimage analysis tasks.
    * Explore the Documentation section to understand how the models are organized and their applications.
    * Find the link to the image.sc forum (Question) to engage with the community and seek help.
    * Locate a model card (e.g., Bacillus Subtilis bacteria segmentation) and examine the information it provides, including the authors, publications, and the model's unique identifier.

**Question**: What is the animal name of the model card you explored?

1. Inside the model card, find the Jupyter notebook that allows you to retrain the model and look for a way to open it in Google Colab.
2. Discover the information about the dataset used to train the model, including its source and download link.
3. Locate a way to request assistance or ask questions related to the model.

## Exercise 2: Download and Install a Model from the BioImage Model Zoo
Time: 10 minutes

**Objective**: Learn how to download a model from the BioImage Model Zoo and integrate it with DeepImageJ in Fiji.

1. Look for a model to segment Histopathology Images using StarDist (e.g., chatty-frog).
2. Download the model for DeepImageJ.
3. Install the downloaded model in Fiji: Navigate to `Plugins > DeepImageJ > DeepImageJ Install Model`.
    * Choose `Install Private Model` and provide the path to the downloaded model zip file.
    * Read any provided notes and click `Install`. If there are no errors, the model is successfully installed, and you can close the installation window.
4. Run a demo of the model: Go to `Plugins > DeepImageJ > DeepImageJ Run`. Select the model you installed and click `Run` on an example image.

The model will provide raw output for Star-Convex polygons, which can be further processed with StarDist 2D NMS if you have the StarDist plugin installed.

## Exercise 3: Deep Learning-Enhanced Instance Segmentation of Cells
Time: 15 minutes

**Objective**: Download a model from the BioImage Model Zoo and use it for cell instance segmentation, post-processing, and visualization.

1. Download the model named `B. Subtilis bacteria segmentation - Widefield microscopy - 2D UNet` from the BioImage Model Zoo (e.g., placid-llama).
    * Use the DeepImageJ Install Model plugin in Fiji to simplify the process.
2. Run a demo of the model in Fiji:
    * Open the DeepImageJ Run plugin.
    * Select the downloaded model.
    * Click "Run an example image" to obtain raw model output.
3. Save both the input and output images for further processing.
4. Perform post-processing on the output images to create cell instances:
    * Split the output channels into independent images: Image > Color > Split channels.
    * Binarize both channels using thresholding.
    * Generate cell landmarks for marker-controlled watershed segmentation.
    * Segment cells using the Marker-Controlled Watershed tool.
**Note**: You can automate this process with an ImageJ macro.

## Exercise 4 (Optional): Processing New Images
**Objective**: Apply the knowledge gained in previous exercises to process new images.

1. In the provided data folder, locate new data in BSubtilis_DeepBacs. Open one of the images and process it using the placid-llama model in DeepImageJ (`Plugins > DeepImageJ > DeepImageJ Run > Run`).
2. Utilize the provided macro to open each image in the folder, process them with the model, extract instance masks, and save the results.
3. Load the results as a time-lapse stack in Fiji and use the TrackMate plugin (if installed) to track the bacteria.

With these exercises, you'll gain hands-on experience with DeepImageJ and the BioImage Model Zoo, empowering you to harness deep learning for bioimage analysis and segmentation.
