# I2K 2023: Leveraging Cloud-Based Virtual Desktops for Bioimage Analysis with BAND and DeepImageJ
This file is a guide for a hands-on session for the [I2K 2023 conference](https://www.i2kconference.org/workshops) that takes place on the 17th of October. The session will be divided into two main parts: one will explore the [BAND](https://band.embl.de/#/eosc-landingpage) platform and the other will explore the DeepImageJ plugin for Fiji as well as the BioImage Model Zoo.

In this hands-on session, you will explore the capabilities of [DeepImageJ](https://deepimagej.github.io) and the [BioImage Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io/#/). These tools are essential for bioimage analysis and deep learning in the field of microscopy. The session is divided into four parts, with a total of four exercises that will help you get acquainted with these powerful tools.

## Pre-requisites
To do this session you will need to install Fiji from [here](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads) in your BAND virtual desktop. You will also need to install the DeepImageJ and [MorphoLibJ](https://imagej.net/MorphoLibJ) plugins in Fiji. 
To do so, in your BAND virtual desktop, install Fiji and then go to `Help > Update...`. In the window that opens, click on `Manage update sites` and select `DeepImageJ` and `IJPB-plugins`. Click `Close` and then `Apply changes`. Restart Fiji and you should be ready to go.

## Exercise 1: Exploring the BioImage Model Zoo
Time: 5 minutes

**Objective**: Familiarize yourself with the BioImage Model Zoo and understand how to access documentation and resources.

1. Go to the BioImage Model Zoo. Here, you will find a vast collection of pre-trained deep learning models for various bioimage analysis tasks.
    * Explore the Documentation section to understand how the models are organized and their applications.
    * Find the link to the image.sc forum (Question) to engage with the community and seek help.
    * Locate a model card (e.g., `Bacillus Subtilis bacteria segmentation`) and examine the information it provides, including the authors, publications, and the model's unique identifier.

**Question**: What is the animal name of the model card you explored?

1. Inside the model card, find the different tools that are able to run this model.
2. Discover the information about the dataset used to train the model, including its source and download link.
3. Locate a way to request assistance or ask questions related to the model.

## Exercise 2: Download and Install a Model from the BioImage Model Zoo
Time: 10 minutes

**Objective**: Learn how to download a model from the BioImage Model Zoo and integrate it with DeepImageJ in Fiji.

1. Look for a model to segment Histopathology Images using StarDist (e.g., chatty-frog).
2. Download the model for DeepImageJ.
3. Install the downloaded model in Fiji: Navigate to `Plugins > DeepImageJ > DeepImageJ Install Model`.
    * Choose `Private Model` and provide the path to the downloaded model zip file.
    * Read any provided notes and click `Install`. If there are no errors, the model is successfully installed, and you can close the installation window.
4. Run a demo of the model: Go to `Plugins > DeepImageJ > DeepImageJ Run`. Select the model you installed and click `Run` on an example image.

## Exercise 3: Deep Learning-Enhanced Instance Segmentation of Cells
Time: 15 minutes
In this exercise, we are going to develop a workflow to segment cells in a microscopy image using DeepImageJ and the BioImage Model Zoo. This pipeline provides a practical and highly relevant approach to cell instance segmentation and post-processing using deep learning and image analysis techniques. It is a critical step in various biological and biomedical research applications where the accurate identification of individual cells is paramount.

**Objective**: Download a model from the BioImage Model Zoo and use it for cell instance segmentation, post-processing, and visualization.



1. Download the model named `LiveCellSegmentationBoundaryModel` from the BioImage Model Zoo (hiding-tiger).
    * Use the DeepImageJ Install Model plugin in Fiji to simplify the process.
2. Run a demo of the model in Fiji:
    * Open the DeepImageJ Run plugin.
    * Select the downloaded model.
    * Click "Run an example image" to obtain raw model output.
3. Save both the input and output images for further processing.
4. Perform post-processing on the output images to create cell instances:
    * Split the output channels into independent images: `Image > Color > Split channels`. We get the boundaries of the cells and the binary segmentation.
    * Binarize both channels using thresholding: `Image > Adjust > Threshold`
        * For the binary mask, set to 0.5 as the lower threshold, click apply and Convert to Mask.
        * For the boundaries, set to 0.35 as the lower threshold, click apply and Convert to Mask.

    * Generate cell landmarks for marker-controlled watershed segmentation by substracting the binary mask from the boundaries: 
        * Go to `Process > Image Calculator`. Set Image 1 to the boundaries (C1) and Image 2 to the binary mask (C2). Select `Subtract` and click `OK`.
    * Segment cells using the Marker-Controlled Watershed tool.
        * To do this, go to `Plugins > MorphoLibJ > Segmentation > Marker-controlled watershed segmentation`. The input image is going to be our mask (C1), the Marker is going to be the result of the subtraction (C1-C2), and the Mask is going to be again our mask (C1). Click `OK` to get the segmented cells.
        * Obtain the Look-Up Table (LUT) for the segmented cells: `Image > Lookup Tables > Glasbey on dark`.

5. Finally visualize the results by `Image > Overlay > Add Image` to add the segmented cells (C1-watershed) with 50% of opacity to the original image. This will allow us to visualize the results.

**Extra**: You can automate this process with an ImageJ macro. You can even export your measurements by selecting your image and go to `Plugins > MorphoLibJ > Analyze > Analyze Regions`. This will generate a table with the measurements of your segmented cells.
